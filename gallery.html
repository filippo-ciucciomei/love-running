  When I joined my most recent company as Head of Customer Service, I inherited a team without structure, clear roles, or measurable objectives. The environment was reactive and demotivating, with inconsistent service and low morale. As the only senior leader with operational and customer expertise, I was responsible for diagnosing the issues and leading a full restructure.
</p>

<p>
I began by meeting each team member individually to understand their challenges, capabilities, and aspirations. This helped build trust and ensured that the changes were shaped by frontline insight, not assumptions. I mapped workflows end-to-end, identified duplicated effort and gaps in accountability, and restructured the function into specialist sub-teams with defined responsibilities and success measures.
</p>

<p>
To embed the new structure, I introduced regular one-to-ones, team briefings, and clear performance expectations. I also created progression paths and coaching plans to increase engagement and give staff a sense of direction. Throughout the process, I communicated openly about the reasons for the changes and encouraged feedback to ensure the team felt included and supported.
</p>

<p>
The impact was immediate: collaboration improved, response times fell, and customer satisfaction rose consistently over the following months. Staff reported feeling more confident and valued, and the team operated with greater ownership and clarity.
</p>

<p>
This reinforced my belief that strong leadership means setting a clear vision, empowering people, and creating the conditions for them to succeed — principles I would bring to leading operational teams within HMCTS.</p>
